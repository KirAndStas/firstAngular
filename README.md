# firstAngular
Hi,
  I am Cyr, from Kyiv. I am student of KPI and study printing&publishing. Furthemore, I have almost any job experience. 
But solving the problems is my wickness. So I feel like it is mine to use WEB to solve everything what I can.I am really like 
to learn. Especially, if we talking about smth that interest me. I do not like easy tasks. It is so much boring and I will be 
fast tried. Serious tasks is another deal. May be I don`t know how do it not, but be 100% sure that I will get it.
  Some of my works you can see on my PROFILE and this one is only one of them. Here I use drag&drop, files upload, ui-router, 
nodeJS, and some not so serious functionalities.
